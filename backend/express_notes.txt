# Middleware - https://expressjs.com/en/guide/using-middleware.html

Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object 
(req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in
the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. 
The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware function in the stack.

# Response Object - https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res

The res object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends 
when it gets an HTTP request.

# Request Object - https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req 

The req object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request 
query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on.
