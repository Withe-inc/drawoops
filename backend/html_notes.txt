The basic structure of any HTML document consists of the following sections 
or elements:

The DTD [document type definition] (!DOCTYPE declaration).
The main container (html element).
The head section (head element).
The body section (body element).

# <html> </html>

The content of this element can be further divided into two sections: 
the head and the body

# <head> </head>

The head section is a container for metadata about the document. 
This metadata can be classified in five categories according to the element used.

Five categories:
* title
* style
* Client-side scripts declared with the <script> element
* Meta statements
* Relational information inserted with <link> element

The information declared in this block will be loaded, because of the order of 
precedence, before the elements in the body.

# <body> </body>

The body of a document is simply the container for its renderable part. 
This is the place to start writing your content (adding headings, paragraphs, 
images, etc.) and the section your visitors will immediately access when the 
page is loaded.
