# Descr.
Socket.io consists of two parts:
* A server that integrates with (or mounts on) the Node.JS HTTP Server socket.io
* A client library that loads on the browser side socket.io-client

During development, socket.io serves the client automatically for us, 
as weâ€™ll see, so for now we only have to install one module: socket.io

# io -- https://socket.io/docs/v3/client-api/#IO

Exposed as the io namespace in the standalone build, or the result of calling 
require('socket.io-client')

io is a Socket.IO server instance

# namespace -- https://socket.io/docs/v3/namespaces/index.html

A Namespace is a communication channel that allows you to split the logic of 
your application over a single shared connection

# socket instance -- https://socket.io/docs/v3/server-socket-instance/

Socket#id -- Each new connection is assigned a random 20-characters identifier.
This identifier is synced with the value on the client-side
